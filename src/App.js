          Many people are skeptical that covid-19 is a big deal (especially in Belarus).

        Unless you're over 60, or are immuno-comprimised{" "}

        click the button a lot before you die.
      </p>
      <p>So this is just like the flu, right?</p>
      <p>
        Not quite. People have been quoting how many deaths per year there are
        for the flu (
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html#:~:text=">
          12,000 to 61,000
        </a>
        ) to the deaths so far with coronavirus (
        <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-maps-and-cases/">
          ~50
        </a>
        ) in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get the full story you usually have to look at more than static
        numbers. In this case, we need to look at:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fatality Rate</li>
        <li>Infection Growth Rate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The flu has a general fatality rate of 0.1%
        <br />
        COVID-19's fatality rate right now is 3.4%

          Social distancing is about how many people you want to kill (I hope

        So you infect two people, and next week they infect two people each, and
        then they infect two more, etc. etc.

      <p>
        So let's say you just came home with the virus. Go ahead and click the
        button once. Now you and two people in your family are infected. Now
        keep clicking it to see how many people's deaths you could have avoided
        by staying home.

        What really sucks about this virus vs. the flu is that you can carry it
        around with you for weeks infecting people before you even know you have
        it. There is no way to know until it's too late. That's why containment
        is so important.

        You just saw that exponential growth is a powerful thing. The
        coronavirus is following a nearly perfect exponential curve in the
        US--even with our low levels of testing. While network marketers hope to
        use it in their favor to gain financial independence, a virus doesn't
        have to be convinced to keep the downline going.
